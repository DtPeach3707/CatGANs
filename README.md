# CatGANs

An AI that generates images of my two cats. Consists of a generator that generates low-resolution (48 pixels wide, 64 pixels tall) images and an upscaler that makes those generated images higher-res by training on the original cat dataset to convert low-res to high-res. My profile picture is in fact an image generated by the Cat GAN. 

The dataset the AI uses to train is very small (<500 images), but in data preprocessing for both generator and upscaling the program multiplies the image count by 4 through flipping and rotation.
